# BiCom System
## Abstract
 
* The term BiCom system, is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system. 

## Features
*	keyfob -> car (like a unidirectional RKE system) 
*	car -> keyfob (car status information for displaying on the keyfob by LED or display) 

## SWOT Analysis
| Strengths | Weakness | Opportunity | Threat |
|-----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| It does not Require physical key to lock/unlock the car | Distance from the car to operate the system is limited |  BiCom can be widely used in cars and other transportation systems instead of RKE |If the encryption algorithm is tampered, the system shall not work properly. |
